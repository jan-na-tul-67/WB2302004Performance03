    <h3>What is the green tree?</h3>
    <p>GreenTrees is a model land equity program where we split the carbon sales with our landowners. Money does not grow on trees, it grows in them. The faster the forest grows, the more carbon gets sequestered, the more carbon there is to sell.</p>
    <blockquote cite=https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-why-are-leaves-green-86160>
        The leaves of most plants are green, because the leaves are full of chemicals that are green.

        The most important of these chemicals is called “chlorophyll” and it allows plants to make food so they can grow using water, air and light from the sun.

        This way that a plant makes food for itself is called “photosynthesis” and it is one of the most important processes taking place on the whole planet.
